# SolvableDessins

This is a database and MAGMA code for computing solvable Belyi maps.

### Prerequisities

You will need a copy of MAGMA on your machine. See http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/ for details. We are currently using a custom installation of MAGMA, so it is unlikely that this code will work with your installation. Sorry :(

### Usage

Simply navigate to the repository, open MAGMA, and then type
```
load "usage.mag"
```
for examples of how to use the MAGMA intrinsics that interact with this database.
