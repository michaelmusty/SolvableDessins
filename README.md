# SolvableDessins

This is a database and Magma code for computing solvable Belyi maps.

### Prerequisities

You will need a copy of Magma on your machine. See http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/ for details. We are currently using a custom installation of MAGMA, so it is unlikely that this code will work with your installation. Sorry :(

### Usage

Currently this code will only work with a custom Magma install.
If you are interested please contact me directly.
In the future I'll include a usage file in the repository
which can be accessed by opening Magma and typing
```
load "usage.mag";
```
