# SolvableDessins

This is a database and Magma code for computing solvable Belyi maps.
Some parts of this code come from work with
Michael Klug,
Sam Schiavone,
Jeroen Sijsling,
and
John Voight.

### Prerequisities

You will need a copy of Magma on your machine.
See http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/ for details.
We are currently using a custom installation of Magma,
so it is unlikely that this code will work with your installation.
Sorry :(

### Usage

Currently this code will only work with a custom Magma install.
If you are interested please contact me directly.
